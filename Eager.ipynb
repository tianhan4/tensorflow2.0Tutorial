    "Hi, in this notebook you will learn the basic of the eager mode in Tensorflow 2.0. TensorFlow's eager execution is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. This makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models, and it reduces boilerplate as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Tensorflor transform from graph execution to eager execution? Maybe it's the same reason why people like to code with Python and Jupyter Notebook: eager execution is much more intuitive and natural for programmers. A compasiron is made in this notebook by checking how these two modes perform the same operation.\n",
